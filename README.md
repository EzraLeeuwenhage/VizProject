# Traviz-app

## About this app

This app is TraViz.

Note: Python 3.8+ is REQUIRED.

## What part we implemented

We implemented the code in all of the .py files of this project.
That includes all of the plots, the data loading, and the UI interaction with Dash.
We use the libraries plotly, pandas, and Dash.

When you first run the code, it will ask a sampling rate.
Higher values make the code run faster.
We suggest trying 30 to see the graphs quickly.

# Organization

- `app.py`: the entry point
- `ave/`: various data loading utilities
- `jbi100_app/`: the main project code, organized by page number
- `jbi100_app/`: all of the graphs shown in the tool, one per file

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+ (add it to your path (system variables) to make sure you can access it from the command prompt)
* Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
